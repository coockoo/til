# Leader

`<leader>` is a key that can be mapped to another key (for example `,` or any other key).
It can be used in vim scripts like

```vim
let mapleader = ","
" Edit ~/.vimrc file in the vertical split
nnoremap <Leader>ev :vsplit $MYVIMRC<CR>
" Source ~/.vimrc file (means reload it)
nnoremap <Leader>sv :source $MYVIMRC<CR>
```

This will set the variable `mapleader` to `,` and will allow creating a mapping using a `<Leader>`
key. Which will allow setting and using commands like `,ev` and `,sv` in normal mode.
